Summary
------------
Standard is a simple MVC php framework, with basic capabilities: Languages, SEO routes, and a beautiful CRUD. I am using this custom CRUD solution for more than 6 years in a lot of projects. After the CRUD application, came the "Front Office". Just a way to manage the URLS, with different languages, database resources and views.

------------
- Php4 > 
- MySql 
- PDO:: Support 
- Apache (htaccess in project's root folder support)

Dependencies
------------
- Bootstrap 3.3.2
- jQuery 1.9.1
- jQuery UI (admin)
- TinyMCE (admin)

Clients and friends that pushed this resource forward, cause wordpress wasn't enough, to complicated for the problem, or just doesnt fitted in. This work was started while working at Intersalus S.A., and evolved as more clients wanted to use it, adding new features that remained available for next small/medium data-driven websites.
